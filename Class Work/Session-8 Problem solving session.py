Jia was organizing her files on the computer. She created a lot of subfolders and shifted files to different folders. Suddenly she wondered whether she can create a data structure very similar to the concept of folders or not. She wants to create a class Folder and wants to add methods like addNewFolder(), addNewFile(), deleteFolder(), and deleteFile(). Also, she wants some condition while creating the new subfolder and files. The datatype of new subfolder should be Folder and  a new file should contain a period(.) in the file name to indicate the extension. Create such data structure to help Jia.

Dhruv just learned the Bubble sort algorithm and recursion. As the bubble sort algorithm needs the repetitive process he thinks that the bubble sort algorithm can be developed using recursion instead of loop. He tried doing this but was not able to complete the program. Write a program in python for the bubble sort algorithm and use recursion to help Dhruv in solving the problem.

Sakshi thought that if we can use recursion for the repetitive process then definitely we can create different shapes as well with the help of recursion instead of using nested loops. Sakshi's friend Mansa said it is impossible to print patterns with the help of recursion. To prove that printing the following patterns is possible with help of recursion write a python program.
